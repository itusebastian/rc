# Fiction Blog

Welcome to my Fiction Blog repository! Here, I share my creative stories and serialized fiction, updated monthly.

## Overview

This repository hosts the live version of my fiction blog, [RelatoCorto.com](https://www.relatocorto.com). Instead of maintaining a traditional blog with all content accessible, I am implementing a unique approach: each month, a new version of the site will be published, and older content will be removed. This means that visitors will only be able to access the latest issue of my fiction online.

## How It Works

- **Monthly Updates**: Every month, a new version of the site is published with the latest stories.
- **Content Visibility**: Previous content will be removed from the live site, ensuring that only the latest issue is available.
- **Minimalist Approach**: The site will have minimal internal pages and ignore traditional SEO suggestions. Each issue will be a standalone project, reflecting a complete narrative.

## Purpose

This approach is an experiment to see if this format affects my writing process. By treating each issue as a complete project and removing older content, I aim to explore how this impacts my creativity and storytelling.
